This task is part of a research study conducted by Dr. Cleotilde Gonzalez at Carnegie Mellon University and is funded by National Science Foundation. The purpose of the research is to study how the presentation of information affects how decisions are made.

Procedures

Throughout the experiment, you will be making a series of decisions to try and maximize your payoff through your choices. You will be presented with either one or both of the following: a descriptive problem with explicit probabilities about outcomes; or a task with two or more buttons on a screen, where each button is associated with a choice option and will affect your payoff. Your selections of options will be associated to the payoff provided. You will be making repeated choices among the options across multiple times until the program instructs you of the end of the experiment.
