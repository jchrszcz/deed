    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>
        This is a decision from experience block.
        You can choose either A or B, each option is associated with one or more payoff amounts.
        For fifty choices, you will see the associated payoff but receive no compensation.
        After that, a final choice using the same payoff structure will determine your end-of-study payment.
