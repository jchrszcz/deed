<p>
In this study you will be making choices between two different lotteries shown as two buttons: A
and B.
Your choices are divided into blocks, and you will be making choices for <strong>3 blocks</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Each block will ask you to make <strong>choices of two types</strong>: choices from Description and from
Experience.
The choices may appear in any order (e.g., Description first and Experience second,
or vice versa).
</p>

<p>
In making <strong>choices from Experience</strong>, you will be allowed to explore the outcomes of the two
buttons for a fixed number of times, before you make one consequential choice that will
determine your bonus payment.
</p>

<p>
In making <strong>choices from Description</strong>, you will be shown the actual possible outcomes and their
associated probabilities before you make a choice that will determine your bonus payment.
</p>

<p>
Although you will not received feedback about <strong>each</strong> consequential choice, you will be shown the cumulative number of points obtained and the corresponding dollar value <strong>at the end of each block</strong>.
Please note that each lottery can have gains or losses.
If the number of points  you get as a result of the lottery is negative, your bonus payment will be set to zero. 
In any case, your goal is to complete the study with as many points as possible.
</p>


<p>
The cumulative points obtained from all the decisions you make across all the blocks will be
converted into your bonus payment, your bonus will range from $0 to $2.50.
This bonus payment will be added to your base payment of $2.50. 
</p>

<p>
Good luck!
